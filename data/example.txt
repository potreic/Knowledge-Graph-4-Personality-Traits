Scenario: The Project Phoenix Crisis Meeting
The project was two weeks behind schedule, and the team called an emergency meeting to figure out a new plan.

Alex (Project Manager): Alex arrived 10 minutes early, his original project plan already updated with red ink, highlighting every missed deadline. He sat quietly at the head of the table, nervously tapping his pen and clearly distressed, worrying that this failure would reflect badly on his career. When the team started brainstorming, he sighed, "I don't think we need 'creative' ideas right now. These new, unvetted tools are too risky. We just need to stick to the original plan and work harder." He listened intently to everyone but didn't say much else, just politely nodding, clearly preferring to be by himself to re-work the numbers.

Ben (Lead Developer): Ben rushed in five minutes late, spilling a bit of coffee on his shirt. "So sorry, everyone! My desk is an absolute black hole!" he laughed, his voice filling the room and charming everyone instantly. When Alex explained the problem, Ben was completely unfazed. "This is a fantastic opportunity!" he clapped, jumping up to the whiteboard. "I was just reading a wild article about a new generative AI framework. What if we scrap 80% of our current backend and rebuild it using that? It's creative, it's exciting!" He then noticed Alex tensing up and immediately softened his tone. "Or, just a thought. Alex, you look stressed. What can I do to help your part of the plan? I'm happy to help anyone who's stuck."

Chloe (Lead Designer): Chloe confidently took charge, standing up and moving to the whiteboard next to Ben. "Okay, let's stop the chaos," she said, her voice assertive. "Ben, no new frameworks. That's a distraction and totally impractical. And Alex, your original plan is what got us into this mess. It's too rigid." She didn't mince words and seemed completely calm, focused only on the solution. "I've already re-written the schedule. We'll work in focused 2-hour design sprints, no exceptions. I don't care if the solution is boring, I care that it works and ships on time. This is the only practical way forward." She ignored the team's groans and started writing the new tasks.
